# NEO Dapi introduction

NEO Dapi is a generic Dapi standard in the NEO environment that is maintained by NEL in conjunction with O3 and other NEO community members.

The programs that provide Dapi come in a variety of forms, including NEL's Teemo Chrome extension wallet, O3 wallet and other forms.

We do our best to implement the overall consistencey and compatibility of the Dapis, but each Dapi provider (program) varies slightly depending on its own characteristics.

Here we will provide the developer Dapi calling methods (part of which are only related to the NEL's Teemo Chrome extension wallet).

# Teemo extension wallet

Teemo is a Chrome extension wallet developed by NEL. The wallet aims to minimize Dapp developers'time spent  on the front-end, so that Dapp developers could focus on Dapp development itself, rather than on interactions with NEO.

Another feature of the extension wallet is security.The Teemo wallet protects the user's wallet private key inside the extension, which Dapp cannot access directly. And user authorization is required when signing a signature(sending a transaction) using a private key each time. In fact,the user's address is invisible to the unauthorized Dapp. In this way, users only need to trust and use one and the same wallet and can safely try any novel Dapps without worrying about security issues
